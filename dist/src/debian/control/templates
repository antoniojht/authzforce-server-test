Default: false
Description: Do you want to keep the test domain created by default?
 The installation creates a test domain by default to get started testing the API quickly. If this is a production system, you may not need this
 (answer: No). If you answer No, you can always create domains later with the API.

Template: [[productId]]/restartTomcat
Type: boolean
Default: true
Description: Do you want to apply recommended Tomcat settings for AuthZForce (and restart Tomcat to apply changes)?
 We recommend the following Tomcat settings for AuthzForce:
        JAVA_OPTS='"-Djava.awt.headless=true -Djavax.xml.accessExternalSchema=http -Xms1024m -Xmx1024m -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -server"'
 Do you agree to apply these settings to Tomcat init script (/etc/default/tomcat8) now?
 If you answer No, you can always apply these manually and restart Tomcat later with this command:
        $ systemctl restart tomcat8
