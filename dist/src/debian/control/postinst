echo "If Tomcat takes too long to start, especially to load the AuthZForce webapp, it is very likely caused by lack of entropy on your host for secure random number generation. Having enough entropy is critical for security reasons, especially in production. If and only if you are using this AuthzForce instance for testing only, you may speed up Tomcat startup by adding this JVM argument to the JAVA_OPTS variable in Tomcat service configuration file '/etc/default/tomcat8': '-Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom'"
